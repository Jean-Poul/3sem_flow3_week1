### Lifting state

1) What is meant by the react term “Lifting State Up”?
Lifting state up and down enables you to scale your state management with plain React. When more components are interested in particular state, you can lift the state up until you reach a common parent component for the components that need access to the state.

2) Where do you lift it up to?
You lift a state up to the parrent component


3) Which way does React recommend data to flow: From sibling to sibling, from bottom to top or from top to bottom?
states does not go sideways so we lift a state from bottom to top and then from top to bottom.


4) Lifting state up, involves a great deal of boilerplate code, what’s the benefit we get from doing “things” like this?
Boilerplate is a section of code that doesn't change and can be re-used anywhere. Instead of re-writing the same code for every new project, developers use boilerplate to avoid risk of error and save time.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
